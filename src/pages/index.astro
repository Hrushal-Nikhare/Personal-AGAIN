	<h1>Hello There!</h1>
	<p>Namaste and welcome to my website! I'm a programmer based in India, and if coding were a sport, I'd probably be a footballer. But since I'm not that good with my feet, I stick to writing code instead. When I'm not busy trying to debug my code, you can usually find me on the football field, trying to debug my footwork. As a programmer, I believe that humor is the best debugging tool, and I bring that same lighthearted approach to everything I do. Whether you're looking for help with a coding project or just want to chat about the latest football match, I'm always here to connect with like-minded people who appreciate a good laugh. So grab a cup of coffee and let's see if we can debug the world together!</p>
